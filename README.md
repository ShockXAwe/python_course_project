# python_course_project

Objective: 

Create a website where users can virtually get in line to get help desk support. Logging in will be required to create a help desk ticket to get in line to get assistance from techs.

Techs will have an admin view where they are able to see who is in line and change the status of the tickets from open, to currently being helped, to closed.

______________________________________________________________

Python/Flask based
sqllite will be used to store user accounts and tickets.
